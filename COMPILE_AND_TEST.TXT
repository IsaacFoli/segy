To compile the program you need the following:

A working "C" compiler installation, along with libc and libm libraries.
A working "make" utility.
Optionally the SDL library to enable -view switch.

Make files are provided for GNUGCC/Cygwin inside the source dir.
To compile the program, issue the command:

make -f makefile.linux-gnu

or

make -f makefile.win

you will end with an executable name segy-change in the same directory 
of the source files.

To test the program a data file named "test_data.segy" is given, the command

segy-change -f test_data.segy -only_n_traces 200 -do_ps A4,10,0.001 > test_data.ps

should produce a postscript file named "test_data.ps" which 
output should be similar to the given file "test_data.jpg".
